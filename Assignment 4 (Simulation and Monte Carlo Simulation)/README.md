# Assignment 3: Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation Problems

## Assignment Overview

This assignment includes various simulation and Monte Carlo simulation problems, utilizing R for Monte Carlo simulations and Excel for simulation models.

## Problem Descriptions

#### Problem 1: Monte Carlo Integration for π Estimation

This problem involves using Monte Carlo integration to estimate the value of π by generating pairs of uniform random numbers and counting the fraction that falls inside the unit quarter circle. 

#### Problem 2: Bicycle Salesperson Bonus Simulation

In this scenario, a simulation model is developed to calculate the expected bonus for a salesperson in a bicycle shop, who earns a bonus for selling more than four bicycles a day, with varying bonuses based on the model of bicycles sold.

#### Problem 3: 401(k) Balance Prediction Model

This problem entails creating a simulation model to predict the 401(k) balance of an individual contributing to a retirement plan with employer matching, based on expected returns from different investment options and salary growth.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: Used for creating the Monte Carlo simulation.
- **Excel**: Utilized for simulation models and calculations.
