# NU Industriesâ€™ Linear Optimized Profit Maximization

## Project Overview

This project addresses the profit maximization challenge faced by NU Industries, a manufacturing company with two production plants and three product lines: Widgets, Gadgets, and Flugels. The objective is to determine the optimal product mix, marketing strategy, and resource allocation that maximizes profits over the next five sales periods, considering various constraints such as labor, raw materials, storage, and transportation costs.

## Business Problem

NU Industries is tasked with preparing a production plan that aligns with its contract obligations while maximizing profits. The complexity arises from the need to allocate limited resources efficiently across multiple products and sales periods, all while dealing with fluctuating costs, storage limits, and marketing influences on demand.

## Methodology

To tackle this problem, the project employed **linear programming** and the **simplex method** using the Python package **PuLP**. A model comprising 120 variables and 44 constraints was developed to represent the operational challenges faced by NU Industries. The solution yielded a profit of **$7,132,135** over the designated sales cycle, with recommendations for optimizing resource usage and addressing key constraints such as raw material availability.

## Key Results

- The model successfully optimized the product mix and resource allocation to maximize profits.
- Marketing efforts were strategically allocated to promote Flugels, the product with the highest profit margin.
- Sensitivity analysis revealed potential improvements by increasing storage capacities and raw material limits.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of linear programming in addressing complex profit maximization scenarios within a manufacturing context. The insights gained from this analysis provide actionable recommendations to enhance NU Industries' profitability and operational efficiency.
