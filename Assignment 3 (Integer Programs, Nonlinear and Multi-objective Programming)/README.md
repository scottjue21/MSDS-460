# Assignment 3: Integer, Nonlinear, and Multiobjective Programming Problems

## Assignment Overview

This assignment includes a variety of optimization problems, ranging from integer programming to nonlinear and multiobjective programming. Each problem presents a real-world application and challenges students to formulate and solve using mathematical models. **Excel Solver** was used to demonstrate an alternative tool outside of Python for solving these complex problems.

## Problem Descriptions

#### Problem 1: Fertilizer Production Optimization

An engineer at Fertilizer Company aims to produce a new fertilizer using two raw materials, constrained by budget. The relationship between the quantities of raw materials and the total fertilizer produced is modeled as a nonlinear function. The objective is to maximize fertilizer production while adhering to budget constraints.

#### Problem 2: Triangle Area Maximization with Constraints

This problem involves maximizing the area of a triangular-shaped fenced region using a fixed length of fencing material. The challenge is to model the problem as a constrained nonlinear program, with the goal of finding the optimal triangle dimensions that maximize the enclosed area.

#### Problem 3: Tiny Toy Company Goal Programming

The Tiny Toy Company manufactures three types of toys, each with different material and labor requirements. The objective is to create a goal programming model to minimize material over-utilization, ensure budgetary adherence, and maximize labor utilization. Priorities include the efficient use of plastic, budget adherence, and production labor hours.

#### Problem 4: XYZ Company Advertising Campaign

XYZ Company is designing an advertising campaign across television and radio to meet exposure targets. The objective is to achieve a balance between minimizing costs and maximizing audience reach, particularly within two key demographic groups. The problem is modeled as a linear goal program that considers total exposure, budget limits, and demographic priorities.

#### Problem 5: Pharmacy Revenue Prediction Model

A large food chain aims to model the relationship between pharmacy revenue and hours of operation. Two models are proposed: a linear and a nonlinear function, each fitted to historical data. The goal is to identify the model that best predicts revenue for an increased number of operating hours and determine which model provides a better fit for the data.
