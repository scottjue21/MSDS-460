# Assignment 1: Linear Programming Problems

## Assignment Overview

This assignment consists of five distinct linear programming problems, each addressing different decision-making scenarios. The problems involve formulating LP models to minimize costs, maximize profits, or solve production planning challenges, followed by solving the LP models analytically or graphically where applicable.

## Problem Descriptions

#### Question 1: SteelCo Production Optimization
SteelCo produces three types of steel at two mills with limited furnace capacity. The company must meet minimum production demands while minimizing production costs. A linear programming model is formulated to allocate production time at each mill, ensuring furnace utilization is balanced, demand constraints are met, and costs are minimized.

#### Question 2: Graphical Solution of LP
This question involves a linear program with two decision variables aimed at maximizing the objective function. The problem is solved graphically, identifying the feasible region and the optimal solution for the objective function. The LP is also rewritten in standard equality form.

#### Question 3: Finco Investment Strategy
Finco must determine the best investment strategy to maximize cash on hand by the beginning of month 5. With various revenue and expense schedules across months and different investment options, an LP model is formulated to maximize profit through optimal investment over time.

#### Question 4: Turkeyco Profit Maximization
Turkeyco produces two types of turkey cutlets with varying meat composition and sale prices. A linear programming model is used to maximize profit while adhering to sales and product composition constraints. The optimal number of turkeys to purchase and the profit-maximizing combination of cutlets are determined.

#### Question 5: Production Planning for Cost Minimization
A company needs to plan quarterly production to meet demand while minimizing production and inventory costs. The problem is formulated as an LP model where production capacity, storage limits, and increasing production costs are taken into account. The solution identifies the optimal production schedule for the entire year.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Used for formulating and solving the LP problems, utilizing libraries such as `pulp` for linear programming and optimization.
