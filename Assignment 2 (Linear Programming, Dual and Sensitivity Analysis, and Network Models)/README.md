# Assignment 2: Linear Programming, Dual and Sensitivity Analysis, and Network Models Problems

## Assignment Overview

This assignment consists of four distinct linear programming problems, each requiring the formulation and solution of LP models. The problems span a range of real-world applications, including manufacturing, resource allocation, transportation, and scheduling. **Excel Solver** was used to demonstrate an alternative tool outside of Python for solving the LPs and generating sensitivity analyses.

## Problem Descriptions

#### Question 1: Dual Problem Formulation and Primal-Dual Analysis

This problem involves writing the general dual problem associated with a given LP and interpreting key dual variables. The primal formulation relates to resource allocation, and the analysis includes determining fair-market prices for resources and interpreting surplus variables in the dual problem.

#### Question 2: Carco Production Problem

Carco manufactures cars and trucks, and the problem asks to maximize profit while considering resource constraints, such as machine and steel availability, and marketing requirements. The problem also requires analyzing the impact of changes in profit margins and resource availability using sensitivity analysis.

#### Question 3: Napkin Cleaning Transportation Problem

A catering company must minimize the cost of cleaning napkins or purchasing new ones while ensuring clean napkins are available daily. The problem involves formulating this scenario as a minimum-cost transportation problem with different cleaning methods and purchasing options.

#### Question 4: University Course Assignment Problem

This problem involves assigning professors to courses across two semesters to maximize total satisfaction, taking into account each professor's preferences for courses and teaching times. The problem is modeled as a network flow problem where professors are assigned to different courses and semesters based on their preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **Excel Solver**: Used for solving linear programming models and performing sensitivity analysis.
